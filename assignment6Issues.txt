Issue 3: heroku open

    "./config" error --> result of gitignore --> app crashed as a result
    Pushed config files to heroku into a new seperate.

    At this point there were some issues with my branches and heroku so I made completely separate repo on github
    with the appropriate code and hosted that instead.

        1. heroku logs						                                          [checked to see cause of error]
        2. # server/config/config.js				                                [modified .gitignore]
        3. port: process.env.PORT || 8080                                   [modified config.js]
        4. git add .					                                              [staged changes]
        5. git commit --allow-empty -m "removed config file from .gitignore	[commited changes]
        6. git push heroku master			                                      [pushed change to heroku]
        7. heroku ps:scale web=1                                            [deployed application]
        8. heroku open                                                      [Opened application]
